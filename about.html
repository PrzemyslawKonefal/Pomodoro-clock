        <h2>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h2>
        <div  class="paragraph">
        <img  src="images/pomodoro.jpg" alt="pomodoro">
        <p> The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.<br>
          The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.<br>
          These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.</p>
        <span style="font-weight: 800;">Why is Pomodoro better than a traditional way of getting things done?</span>
                <ul>Many researches prove incomparable advantages of using <br> Pomodoro Technique over one-run workflow.<br><span style="line-height: 40px"> Here are the highlithgts:</span>
                <li> More focus and concentration. </li>
                <li> Less stress. </li>
                <li> Better management of the interruptions.</li>
                <li> Keeping high motivation levels. </li>
                <li> Reinforcing the determination in order to achieve something.  </li>
                <li> Better awareness of the time you need to get things done. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><span  style="font-weight: 600">But how is that possible?<br></span>
                It all comes to testing yourself and spacing out your studies.<br>
                Testing yourself is the single most effective study technique. Though researchers aren’t sure why, many studies have shown that our memory actually functions better as a result of testing, a phenomenon known as the “testing effect.”<br>
                Having a regular, planned breaks help your brain compose new knowledge. It makes you memorize more things at the time and for a longer term. Basic method of studying(especially with unplanned, random breaks e.g to check Facebook) is massively chaotic and your brain is also immersed in that mess.</p>
                <p><span  style="font-weight: 600">Try it once</span><br>And I promise, You will never come back to oldschool method of learining again!</p>

        <h2>How to use Pomodoro?</h2>
        <div  class="paragraph">
        <img src="images/how.jpg" alt="pomodoro">
        <p>If you wanna squeeze the effectiveness out of your time, here is the pattern you need to follow:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Create a checklist of things to be done.</li>
          <li>Start the clock. focus ONLY on checking points from the list.</li>
          <li>Use breaks to rest both mentaly and physically.</li>
          <li>Regularly check how many things from the list you have done.<br> If you notice significant decrease of productiveness - take a longer break(optimally 15 minutes). </li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, If you still struggle to focus on the tasks, you can try to improve your perception by implementing some of the advises below: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Clean your desk.</li>
          <li>Throw your phone far, far away(or at least turn the notifications off).</li>
          <li>Play classical music in the background.</li>
          <li>Reward yourself - after finishing a task/group of tasks, appreciate yourself. Play with your pet for a minute or eat a cookie. Your brain will create a corelation.</li>
        </ul>
